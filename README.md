# Visualize theme for Hugo

As a way to learn hugo, ported a free theme [Visualize](https://templated.co/visualize) to hugo.

## Usage

- Content is stored as JSON data.
- Modify `header.json` for the header content and social information.
- Modify `main.json` for the main content of images and content.

I wanted to use Visualize theme for my photographs and also use Hugo (to get a feel of how to use it) while doing so.
